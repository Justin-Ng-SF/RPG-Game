# RPG Style Tile Game

This is a simple 2d game I was making for fun. It is made using exclusively Java.

---
Features a tileset to decrease memory usage by 4 times leading to increased performance while requiring 6Kb of memory per tile.
By allowing only tiles within view to be rendered, rendering efficiency was increased substantially.
Features data driven map system allowing for simple map creation and modification via txt file.
